Summary

This project is used to calculate whether or not you had a productive day. The productivity calculator file prompts the user to enter several inputs on how they spent their day, then calculates whether or not the day was productive. The data is then sent to SQL, which collects data for a number of days then creates a table on how productive you have been over a period of time.

Implementation

When you run the program you will be prompted to fill out 6 different inputs. Fill out each of the inputs and then the program will output a productivity score and whether or not you had a productive day. You can run the program daily with your information for each day and the data will be sent to MYSQL. At the end of the month you can you check MySql which will have charted all of your information.
